What is the Purpose of this project?
To demonstrate how to get started building Azure Landing Zones using Powershell and Bicep. 

What is an Azure Landing Zone?
An Azure Landing Zone is a cloud Architecture that allows you to build scalable multi-subscription environments that scale.
For further description of Azure Landing Zone Architecture see: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/landing-zone/

Who is the intended audience?
Individuals, and small businesses who have a Microsoft Customer Agreement Azure License and are interested in experimenting with Azure Landing Zone deployments.

What are the limitations of using Azure Landing Zones with a Microsoft Customer Agreement Azure License? 
I couldn't find this anywhere in Microsoft Docs, however, Azure customer support has explained to me that "Customer led customers can only start with two subscriptions. They can create a third subscription two hours later. Then, they can create one new subscription every 24 hours." What this means, is that you must wait 24 hours between Subscription deployments. 

Requirements:
Install the Azure Powershell Module
Follow the directions at https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/install-az-ps?view=azps-9.2.0

Install Bicep tools
Follow the directions at https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/install

Configure Azure permissions for ARM tenant deployments. You must configure your Azure AD directory, and user account permissions, to be able to be able to deploy resources to the Azure Resource Manager at the Tenant level. Follow the directions at https://github.com/Azure/Enterprise-Scale/wiki/ALZ-Setup-azure 

How-to: 
This project is designed as a light-touch deployment. Meaning that once you download deployment files, and the required tools, all you have to do is run the Landing Zone deployment Powershell script, enter your desired Location, Managementgroup Name, point to the location of the necessary Bicep files, then Azure should do the rest.
